# Nexus: Strategic Roadmap (2025-2026)

This roadmap outlines the future trajectory of the Nexus ecosystem, focusing on scale, diversity, and deployment efficiency.

## 🟢 Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETED)

- [x] **Universal Orchestrator**: Automated profiling-to-export pipeline.
- [x] **Massive Model SLI**: Ingesting 1T+ models on 16GB VRAM.
- [x] **NIWT Profiling**: Neural Information-Weighted Tower for circuit discovery.
- [x] **Core Distillation**: Activation Anchoring and Sparse Intent Routing.
- [x] **100% Test Coverage**: Robust verification for all core components.

## 🟡 Phase 2: Scale & Diversity (IN PROGRESS)

- [ ] **Multi-Node Distillation**: Distributed knowledge extraction across multiple GPUs.
- [ ] **Cross-Modal Retrieval**: Enhanced Librarian capabilities for high-fidelity audio/video context.
- [ ] **Automatic Adapter Merging**: Dynamic weight-averaging for conflicting capabilities.
- [ ] **Live Teacher Registry**: Cloud-synced model registry for instant capability updates.

## 🔴 Phase 3: Edge & Production (UPCOMING)

- [ ] **Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)**: 4-bit and 2-bit student models.
- [ ] **Mobile Porting**: Optimized inference for iOS/Android (MLX/CoreML).
- [ ] **Nexus-as-a-Service**: High-throughput FastAPI wrapper with multi-adapter hot-loading.
- [ ] **Self-Improving Loop**: Student performance feedback for autonomous teacher re-profiling.
