## Legend
- **Strict Sample Verified**: Confirmed that the `--sample 5` argument correctly limits the download/processing.
- **Data Verified**: Confirmed the output `data.jsonl` contains valid [modalities](file:///mnt/d/Research%20Experiments/manus_model/src/07_validate_all_datasets.py#165-205) structure and absolute paths.
- **Blocked**: Currently inaccessible due to API deprecations or technical limitations (e.g. Common Voice).
