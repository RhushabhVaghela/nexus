add more complex stuff, like really complex may be add more entries like 1 million maybe?

### User Input

also here is the remianing stuff@[docs/FILES_5-11_COMPLETE_IMPLEMENTATIONS.md]@[docs/FILE_INDEX_AND_REFERENCE.md]@[docs/04_sft_training.py] 

also plesae finetune the training data for fullstack, since we are make the model equicalent to manus models like manus 1.6 max and lovable to achive the same but locally

### User Input

Fullstack/Lovable Engine: Rewrote 02_generate_trajectories.py to generate 1,000,000 complex full-stack app creation tasks (React, Next.js, Node, etc.)  - create even more complex and much more specific examples, also regarding templates of websites and applications, how are we going to integrate them, so the model can create professional websites just by simple prompts? And exelent and accurate ability to clone ore replica just by looking at the image/rough diagram/video, and also have realtime research and search ability as well. YOu can increate the training data set limit to whichever size you may like, no restrictions on that, but I need the end model to be production ready and can compete against manus, lovable, replit, etc.

you can increate the training size to half a billion training sets with more general and advance resoning as well apart from fullstack examples

### User Input

for more specific more training data, you can do deep research and go through the UI, frontend, backend, templates (like protforlio, visualization dashboards, templates for slides, etc you can research of other templates as well) of application like manus, replit, lovable, etc to make a complete replica of them. also here are some few more resources as we @docs/new docs
